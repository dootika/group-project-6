# Anime Analysis

# Description
This is the project of group - 6 for the course MTH208. In this project we have analysed the dataset from kaggle containing anime rating data from two different websites ![MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) and ![Anime Planet](https://www.anime-planet.com/) and tried to get some insights related to groeth of anime over time, genres, studios, etc. Along with that, we have also built an app using `Shiny` package in R Studio. 

## Instruction to run the code:
- If while running the code you run into `package not installed` error then please uncomment the first few lines of code and run them first.
